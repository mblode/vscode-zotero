# VS Code Zotero

This package adds Zotero support to VS Code Markdown editing. To use it, you will need to have the Better BibTeX plugin installed in Zotero.

## Features

If you don't feel like typing citations out (and let's be honest, you don't), executing 'Zotero Picker' will call up a graphical picker which will insert these for you, formatted and all.

- Activate via Command Palette (command + shift + P): Type "Zotero Picker" and press enter.
- Activae via keyboard shortcut: Use alt+shift+z

## Requirements

**IMPORTANT:** Zotero, with Better BibTeX installed, must be running while you use these.
